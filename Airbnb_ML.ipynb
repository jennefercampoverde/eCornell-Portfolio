I removed any columns that had objects as their data type, the reason is because it would cause issues when trying to train the model on data, since it is not a numerical value. Since the columns have various responses within each entry, creating numerical numbers would be complex such as for location and number of baths/bedrooms.I kept features with float or integer data types, for some that were objects such as amenities, I turned it into a boolean, as it can be easily interpreted when model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different preparation techniques that I used to prepare my data for modeling was mainly used to create a condensed, clear and non-repetitive data set. I looked through all the features and eliminated any that I thought would not be useful or did not provide much relevant importance. I then started off with renaming my features because some of the feature names were a little bit confusing. After that I checked to see if there were any null values in my data set. Following that I determined which features had the empty values and put them in a list. I looked at their data types and realized some of the features consisted of objects but also did not really seem relevant in order to obtain a overall review score. I also wanted to create a decent size dataset, where there was not too many features. I dropped uneccesary columns and replaced null vlaues for floats with the average of that column such as the response rates.\n",

    "My model would be a linear regression model since I am dealing with a regression problem. The reason why I picked this type of model is because it is easy model to analyze visually and it is able to handle large data sets with minimal resources. This is a good consideration since the Airbnb company has a large amount of Airbnb hosts on it's platform, meaning large quanities of data is being dealt with.\n",

    "\n",
    "My plan to train the model involves some additional packages such as the LinearRegression scikit-learn linear model. I started by creating the label and the feature for this model. Following that I created the training and test data set. After that I created a multiple linear regression model and printed out the parameters for the model such as the intercept which is the alpha value and the weights for each feature.Then I analyzed the R^2 score and the RMSE value to see how it described the results from the model. The results were not perfect in terms of that it generated all the correct answers which means that there was no overfitting so far, but instead it was close to the test data results, meaning that this model can generalize well. This means that the model can learn on it's own when dealing with new datasets and is able to handle these changes in data.>"
